    "### Abstract:\n",
    "This notebook presents a solution for the SemEval-2018 Task 1: Affect in Tweets (AIT-2018). Given a tweet and an emotion (sadness, anger, fear, joy), the model should output an intensity classification (0, 1, 2, 3). To do this, two different approaches were implemented: the first one using a knowledge based preprocessing the second one using word embeddings (BERT). Finally, several models were used and compared to do the classification.\n"

    "* **User**: All user mentions were substituted with '@user'\n",

    "* **TF-IDF**: SkLearn's TfidfVectorizer was used to perform TF-IDF\n",

    "After analysing the results, we conclude that the best results were mostly obtained by using BERT. Reggarding the models, SVM and Random Forest tend to outperform the rest for almost all the tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the future, other BERT algorithms and embeddings should be tested and a convulutional neural network (CNN) should also be implemented. Fine tuning the models even further with either types of preprocessing should also contribute to a better overall accuracy."
